      Here are some example images. Some optimised, some not. Some at different
      resolutions too!
    </h1>

    <h2>Here's an unoptimised image at full resolution:</h2>
    <img src="./images/parkour01.jpg" alt="a parkour pic" />

    <h2>
      Here's a more optimised image using the webp format which has a smaller
      file size
    </h2>
    <img
      src="./images/parkour01converted.webp"
      alt="parkour pic in webp format"
    />

    <h2>
      Finally, here is a very well optimised image which has been converted to
      webp, and also reduced in resolution to match our web page
    </h2>
    <img
      src="./images/parkour01convertedreduced.webp"
      alt="parkour pic converted and reduced in resolution"
    />
